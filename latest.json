    "notes": "### v1.11.1\n#### NEW FEATURES (NOT REALLY NEW)\n- counters tracking is now working\n- death tracking also working\n\n#### BUG FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS\n- fix icons for allied skills\n- fix avele name (no longer the singer)\n- (maybe) fixed thar special interaction showing as unknown\n- removed g2 mirrors from hp bar tracking\n\n**NOTE:** Please do note that this is a very barebones patch. Most of the meter features are **not** working properly due to missing packet structures. We are working hard to become fully independent of Herysia's meter-core, but this process is extremely difficult and will take a few weeks.\n\nIf you missed the news, please read the announcement in the discord channel. [#announcements - ramen shop](https://discord.gg/2rwTTKXRwu).\n\n### Current Functionality\n#### Working\n- damage meter\n- basic logs\n- maybe some other stuff\n#### Not Working\n- party/self buff uptime tracking\n- rdps\n- shields\n- stagger\n- identity\n- pretty much anything else not listed here\n\nfull patch notes on [github](https://github.com/MaccolSolZico/loa-logs-kr/releases/latest)\n\nsend bug reports/suggestions to [ramen shop server](https://discord.gg/RXvTMV2YHu)",
